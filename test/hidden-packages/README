This test verifies that
 - two hybrid modules A and B can define (types in) the same non-exported
   (and non-open to be sure) package and have them accessible within the
   hybrid module only.

According to JVMS11 ยง5.3.6, each hybrid module should have an unnamed module,
and each such module is open, and each package in each of these are exported to
the other. Since split packages are disallowed, it would seem it is impossible
for two hybrid modules to define the same package, even non-exported.
