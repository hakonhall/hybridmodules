This experiment tries to run unit test with JUnit 5 using the "standard" or
"naive" approach to whitebox unit testing with hybrid modules:

  1. The modular JAR contains both the module and the unit tests, with a
     module-info.class containing the union (module-info-test.java).

  2. The console launcher non-modular JAR has been changed into a modular JAR.

  3. (2) must require (1) in order to observe that module.
